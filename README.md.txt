# BurningBirdPaySystem


This Android application was desinged as a Database project for COMP3753 Database Management Systems. It's purpose was to demonstrate
how a front end application can communicate with a backend data source. Our backend database solution of choice was Couchbase due to it's
NOSQL nature and the ability to sync documents *instantly*. Furthermore, the offline capabilities that Couchbase offers were also a decidingfactor in our choice.

I was assigned programmer for this project, and take credit for 100% of the development of this application while my group members were
responsible for designing the Couchbase document design and other desinging tasks. 

It is important to note that the authentication part of this application was done without any backend development as the focus for this
project was to design an application that uses a Database, not one that has full authentication. If you wish to see authentication code,
please refer to my HomeCarePlus Projects.
