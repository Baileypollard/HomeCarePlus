# HomeCarePlus

This application was developed as a part of the Computer Science Program at Acadia University. The course COMP 4983 X2 PROJECT
is a core course that requires the student to complete a sizable project using knowledge gained from the previous 3 years. We were given
the freedom to come up with our own ideas and turn them into working applications. 

The application that I designed and developed is called HomeCare+. The purpose of this application is to provide a user-friendly mobile 
solution for scheduling homecare employees work days. The inspiration for this application stemmed from a few comments that my mother
had made about her current application that her company uses. She explained how many of her co-workers are less technologically capable,
and aren't able to navigate through their current application. Therefore, I challenged myself to make an application with a *better* 
more user-friendly UI, while still providing the key features of the application. 

# How to works?

Each employee will be given unique login credentials. These credentials will be used to access both the web panel and the mobile applications. Once the user logs in, they will be able to view their daily client schedules, in chronological order. The user will have the ability to punch in/out once the appointment has been started/completed. Appointments will be verified/declined based off the employees location when starting/completing each appointment. More key features include google maps display of the appointment location, access to client personal information, view previously completed appointments per client, call clients directly from the application and many more!
